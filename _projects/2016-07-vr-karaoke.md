Learned:
never use Google Cardboard
Need to learn graphics better maybe unless something more established like Oculus already does it for you


Evonne Ng and I wanted to do a VR project since those had been popular the last couple years at hackathons. We also wanted to attend some of the workshops so we didn’t have as much time to dedicate sorely to the . We ended up not attending as many workshops, and a lot of it . The result was a spinning cube used in the treasure hunt . As far as kwe knew, there was no text library we could do to do it easily.

Today I learned I do not enjoy doing graphics. This was a graphics heavy project, something neither of which really had experience in.
