Exploration with EmberJS and Firebase

This project stemmed from me trying to decide the pros and cons between some decisions I was making. I wanted to be able to easily make decisions and also be able to account for how important a pro or con item is through weights.

Well I could always use a whiteboard or old school paper, but I thought I could create a drag and droppable list.

I ended up destroying it infavor of using ReactJS since it is the hottest framework and seemed more appropo for what I was trying to do.
