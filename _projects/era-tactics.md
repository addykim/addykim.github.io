A game for the Mobile Computing (Android) course with Mike Scott. My partners Lulu Lu and Kevin Bishop worked on the game logic and I worked on implementing the game using Android practices. 

We went from brainstorming ideas, creating wireframes, and pitching our ideas to other classmates. We wrote the Android game itself and used SugarORM, Lulu drew the assets. 

In the near future, we want to make this a fully featured game and are considering porting it to a cross-platform framework.
