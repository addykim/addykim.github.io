**What did you do this past week?**
Been busy with school.

**What's in your way?**


**What will you do next week?**
Taking care of things I've put off all summer like going to the optometrist, seeing my parents again to grab my interview clothes.

**Experiences in Class**
Do the readings before class! Especially on Monday the in-class quizzes.

This week we were assigned ranks based on how well we are doing in the class.
Assigned project 1
Like any other class, start the projects early. I just work on the project a couple hours a day everyday. This is much less painful than working 10+ hours to get it done last minute.
Go to the office hours.

**Tip(s)-of-the-week**
Interview season is coming up. Practice whiteboarding with someone if you can. It's much different than having a keyboard in front of you. To be honest, I sometimes will pause, and pretend to type on a keyboard in order to help me think what I might be doing if I was coding the actual.
