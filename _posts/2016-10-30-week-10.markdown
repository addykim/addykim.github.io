**Experiences in Class**

This past week had been a rather short week for this class. Monday was a typical day in terms of class structure.

On Wednesday, we had Pariveda, a tech consulting company, come and talk to us about Software Engineering and how they're taking concepts we're learning in class and using it in the real world. Pariveda also hosted a happy hour at Cain & Abels, which I did not attend.

Friday was the 50th UTCS symposium. Alumni and other relevant folks were invited to join the UTCS department to listen to lectures and get updates on the then and now of the department. There was a UTCS 50 Fun Fest, which I did not attend. Class was canceled in favor of attending this event. I did attend the event and got to listen to talks about the latest findings in machine vision, machine learning, AI, and graphics. There were also talks given to discuss CS and how it relates to the rest of the world, such as Public Policy.

This upcoming week will probably put us back into the normal groove of things, as we work on Project 5.

**Tip(s)-of-the-week**

Try mentoring people. It helps you reinforce what you know and bring up what you don't know.
